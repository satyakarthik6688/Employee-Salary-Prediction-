# Employee-Salary-Prediction-
Employee Salary Prediction using machine learning
Salary Prediction Project using SVM
This machine learning project predicts whether an individual's salary is above or below a certain threshold based on demographic and job-related features. It uses a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier and a custom synthetic dataset.

Dataset
The dataset contains the following features:

age (numerical)

education (categorical: Bachelors, Masters, PhD)

department (categorical: Sales, Engineering, HR, Marketing)

experience (numerical, in years)

salary (target: 0 = ‚â§50K, 1 = >50K)

 Objective
To build a machine learning pipeline that:

Preprocesses categorical and numerical data

Trains a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model

Predicts salary classification

Exports predictions to a CSV file
Tech Stack
Python 3.9+

scikit-learn

pandas

joblib

üß† Algorithm Used
‚úÖ Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Kernel: RBF (Radial Basis Function)

Œ≥ (gamma): scale

C (regularization): 1.0

SVM is used due to its effectiveness on small to medium-sized datasets with non-linear decision boundaries.

üôã Custom Input Testing
To test your own inputs:

python
Copy
Edit
import joblib
import pandas as pd

model = joblib.load("model.pkl")
custom_input = pd.DataFrame([{
    'age': 35,
    'education': 'Masters',
    'department': 'Engineering',
    'experience': 8
}])
prediction = model.predict(custom_input)
print("Predicted Salary Class:", prediction[0])

Saves the trained model for later use
